            <p>Bobby Ruiz started Tribal Street wear on November 20, 1989, with his brother Joey. When Bobby was looking for sponsors for a graffiti art/benefit show in San Diego, Carl Arellano, who had a silk-screening business offered to sponsor the show. "It was at that point when we became friends and started to talk about him getting involved with Tribal", says Bobby.

The process started with blank white T-shirts which were given various graphics including tattoo-style designs from Joey. Inspired by his graffiti background Bobby wanted to use bold graphics. Most graphics were Aztec and Mayan influenced. This is how they came up with the name Tribal. They started working with graffiti artists who made hip hop-style graphics. Tribal expanded from T-shirts to apparel and accessories.
